# Introduction

CoW Protocol can have different front ends, depending on the dapp you are interacting with. CoW Swap is the first trading interface built on top of the protocol, followed by a Balancer UI, which integrated CoW Protocol natively in their default trading interface.

While the front end might look familiar, the trading process is quite different from other DeFi DEXes, starting with the fact that users donâ€™t execute a trade transaction, but rather sign an off-chain message with an intent of trading.
