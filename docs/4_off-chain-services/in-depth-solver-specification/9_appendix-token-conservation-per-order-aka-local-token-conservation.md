# Appendix: Token conservation per order (aka Local token conservation)

Among other things, [CIP-11](https://snapshot.org/#/cow.eth/proposal/0x16d8c681d52b24f1ccd854084e07a99fce6a7af1e25fd21ddae6534b411df870) introduced a rather technical constraint, named "local token conservation", or "token conservation per order". In order to explain what this constraint is about, let's first look at the "token conservation per token" constraint, or what we call global token conservation; the fact that no token is created or destroyed during a settlement. We will now showcase why this global notion of conservation is oblivious about what happens in certain subgraphs, and turns out not to be sufficient.

To see this, consider the following example in which there are two user orders: user _a_ sells _1_ unit of token _x_ for at least _1_ unit of token _y_; user _b_ sells _1_ unit of token _z_ for at least _1_ unit of token _y_. A solver uses an external liquidity source to buy 2 units of token _y_ against _1_ unit of token _x,_ and a different liquidity source to buy _1_ unit of token _y_ against 1 unit of token _z._

A solution that returns 1 unit of token _y_ to user _a_ and 2 units of token _y_ to user _b_ satisfies both token conservation per token and has uniform prices. Nonetheless, at an intuitive level, it is unfair to user _a:_ their unit of token _x_ was used to generate 2 units of token _y,_ but the solution allocates them only 1 unit of token _y._ The goal is to specify a constraint that rules out these situations.

To start, suppose that we have a solution that consists of a single trading cycle _C_ of _k_ trades   $$o_1, o_2, \ldots, o_k$$. More precisely, trade $$o_1$$ buys token $$t_1$$ and sells token $$t_2$$, trade $$o_2$$ buys token $$t_2$$and sells token $$t_3$$, and so on, and finally, trade $$o_k$$ buys token $$t_k$$ and sells token $$t_1$$, thus closing the cycle. We now define the exchange rate of a trade $$o_i$$ in the standard way $$p(o_i)$$as the ratio between quantity sold and quantity bought. Then by the "token conservation per token" constraint, it is easy to deduce that

$$p(C) \coloneqq \prod_{o_i \in C} p(o_i) = p(o_1) \cdot p(o_2) \cdot \ldots \cdot p(o_k)= 1.$$

Inspired by the above equation that holds for a single cycle, we now generalise this in the case where a user trade is part of many trading cycles in the proposed solution. More specifically, we denote by $$\mathcal{C}(o)$$  the set of all trading cycles containing the order _o_ in a candidate solution. We require that:

$$\sum_{C \in \mathcal{C}(o)} \lambda_C \cdot p(C) = 1,$$

where $$\lambda_C \geq 0$$ is a non-negative number that is well-defined for each cycle _C_, such that $$\sum_{C \in \mathcal{C}(o)} \lambda_C= 1$$. The above condition can be viewed as an average-case version of the simpler equation that holds for a single cycle and is described above.

The only thing remaining to do is define the weights $$\lambda_C$$ which intuitively should capture the extent to which a given trade is utilised in different trading cycles. To do so, we first define the execution graph _G_(_o_) of a user trade _o_ as the union of all cycles containing the trade _o_, where we use the following convention: we have a node for each of the traded tokens, and for each order $$o$$ that buys token _u_ and sells token _v,_ we add a directed edge (_u, v_) from _u_ to _v_. Thus, we end up with a directed graph _G_(_o_). To simplify things, we remove the edge corresponding to trade _o_ from the graph and call this updated graph the execution graph _G_(_o_) of trade _o._ \
\
**Claim**: It is easy to see that this graph is directed and acyclic ([DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed\_acyclic\_graph)).\
\
**Correction:** We clarify that the above claim, originally made in CIP-11, turns out to not always hold. So, the test mentioned here can only be applied in cases where indeed the execution graph is a DAG. From now on, we will assume this is the case.

Given this directed and acyclic graph _G_(_o_), we now associate each edge $$\alpha = (t, t')$$of the graph with the weight

$$\lambda_\alpha \coloneqq \frac{a_b(\alpha)}{\sum_{\beta \in G(o):\; t_b(\beta) = t} a_b(\beta)}$$.

Intuitively, this weight represents how token _t_ is "distributed" in the orders that are buying token _t_, within the graph _G_(_o_).

We also define $$\lambda_o = 1$$ . Thus, we can now naturally define the $$\lambda$$ terms in the equation above as follows:

$$\lambda_C \coloneqq \prod_{\alpha \in C} \lambda_\alpha,$$

for every cycle containing order _o._ It is now straightforward to prove that these terms now indeed sum up to 1.

To summarise, for a proposed solution, we require that for each executed user order _o_, we must have

$$\sum_{C \in \mathcal{C}(o)} \lambda_C \cdot r(C) = 1,$$

where the terms are defined as above.\

More details about the "token conservation per order" constraint and a straightforward pseudocode implementation of a test that checks the constraint can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1scicpMu3TQZUatY\_\_qzVfWPBFIrmJtb9P1GTvGDkgh8/edit?usp=sharing).

We stress here that the constraint is not enforced when ranking solutions but can be checked retrospectively by inspecting the settlement onchain. Systematic and non-trivial violations of the constraint can result in the slashing of a solver.
