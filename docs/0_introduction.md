# Welcome

CoW Protocol matches trades via [batch auctions](overview/batch-auctions) between users and a variety of on-chain liquidity sources.

Trades in the batch are prioritised such that:

1. [Coincidence of Wants](overview/coincidence-of-wants), ie. (CoWs! 🐮), essentially P2P trading within an existing batch to offer an ever better price than any pool or on-chain liquidity source can.
2. On-chain liquidity using AMMs directly, or via DEX aggregators, depending on which pool/path offers the best price - therefore essentially acting as a DexAggregator of the DexAggregators.
