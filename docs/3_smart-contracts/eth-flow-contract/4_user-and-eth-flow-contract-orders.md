# User and ETH Flow Contract Orders

Every ETH sell order from a user ("user order") will have a unique associated order in the eth-flow contract ("contract order").

This order will be implicitly created when the user deposits ETH.

For simplicity, both orders will have the same representation that is used for settlement orders, but eth-flow order have slightly different parameters in the contract (for example, there is no need to specify a sell token since it's assumed to be WETH).

The next table describes how to convert a user order into a contract order.

Note that what is described here as a user order is not a valid order for the settlement contract. It represents the data used by the eth-flow contract for bookkeeping. The contract order will be the one to be executed.
