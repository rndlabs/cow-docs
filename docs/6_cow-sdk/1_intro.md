# CoW SDK

Unlock an endless world of possibilities via **CoW Protocol SDK** ([@cowprotocol/cow-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cowprotocol/cow-sdk) in NPM)

### First, lets introduce CoW Swap and CoW Protocol <a href="#get-started" id="get-started"></a>

CoW Swap is a Decentralized Application (DApp) and Protocol allowing users to **exchange digital assets directly (peer-to-peer) and via existing trading decentralised exchanges**.

Its novel design maximises trade efficiency and provides a competitive way to ensure best prices.

One of the core ideas is executing **trades in batches**, where users will trade directly using what is known as **“Coincidence of Wants”** (hence the name CoW). In the context of blockchains, batch auctions are a superior mechanism compared to continuous time trading, as they already execute transactions in discrete “blocks” every few seconds.

In consequence CoW Swap **protects users from front-running and other value extraction (known as MEV)**. The mechanism also leverages the concept of “ring trades” to boost liquidity in highly fragmented and long-tail token markets.

Additionally, CoW Swap allows for an improved user experience by facilitating gasless trades, not paying for failed transactions and adaptive routing in case of volatility.

#### Get familiar with CoW Swap <a href="#get-familiar-with-cowswap" id="get-familiar-with-cowswap"></a>

CoW Swap uses CoW protocol. One easy way to get familiar with the protocol is by doing one trade in CoW Swap:

* [https://swap.cow.fi](https://swap.cow.fi/)

You can use it in **Goerli** test net if you want. Otherwise, it is avaiable in **Mainnet** and **Gnosis Chain**.  


Now you are more familiar with the protocol and CoW Swap, let's introduce the SDK in the next section.
