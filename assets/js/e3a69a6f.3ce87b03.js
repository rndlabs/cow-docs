This is because the design of Constant Function Market Makers (CFMM) does not allow for trading to occur simultaneously in a block. In order for CFMM to work, it needs to process transactions in sequential order, so that the pool can know what is the ratio of tokens in it, and execute the trades with prices accordingly to it. Even though the block will have multiple trades of the same token pairs, each trade will obtain a different price depending on the order in which they trade against the pool. Because of this, the ordering of transactions becomes highly important, and as a consequence, we have seen the rise of MEV (Miner Extractable Value) where the miners freely decide in what order the trades arrive at the pool. Therefore favouring some trades in comparison to others, and ignoring the truthful order of arrival. Batch Auctions allow the trades within a batch to have the same uniform clearing price and therefore there's no point in miners reordering the trades. With CoW Protocol leveraging Batch Auctions, traders in Ethereum can now get the same price for the same token pairs they trade at the exact same block."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Besides being able to establish a uniform clearing price across the trades that happen within a batch, CoW Protocol Batch Auction price finding mechanism is also designed to offer a better price that no other CFMM can offer.
