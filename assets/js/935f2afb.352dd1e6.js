All we need to do is add a check in the isValidSignature implementation that the current block timestamp is older than some validFrom value. The CoW Protocol services constantly simulate isValidSignature before each batch, meaning that the order would get automatically picked up and included in a batch auction once it matures. Since the signature validation would revert if the check is not met, this means that we would effectively have a trust-less check preventing the order from being filled.
